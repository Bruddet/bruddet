 * This file is a custom type definition for the Sanity schema.
 * It is used to define the types of the custom content fields in the Sanity schema.
 * The types defined here are used in the frontend to render the custom content fields.
 * Update custom types accordingly after running sanity typegen. The custom types are not generated by the typegen command.
 * Will only need to be updated if the schema changes for the extended types here.
 * The custom types are named with the prefix "Custom_" or "Custom" to avoid conflicts with the generated types and easier lookup.
 * Import the custom types through sanity/types in the frontend.
