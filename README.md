# Bruddet ‚õ∞

This is the repository contains Bruddet's frontend and cms application

## .env.local

You will need a .env.local file for the api tokens. Copy and rename the .env file and replace SANITY_EDITOR_TOKEN, SANITY_READ_TOKEN. These tokens are stored in "basen - shared" in 1Password. New tokens can be generated in api/tokens where you manage the Sanity project (https://www.sanity.io/organizations/oY2dfMupw/project/0chpibsu/api#tokens).

## Run project

To run a development version of the project locally run the following command in the root folder:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start Remix in development mode. You can then visit the following URLs:

- [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) - The local version of the frontend website

## Remix commands

### Build üõ†Ô∏è

To build all apps and packages in frontend, run the following command in the root folder:

```
npm run build
```

### Develop üíª

To develop all apps and packages in frontend, run the following command in the root folder:

```
npm run dev
```

### Production

To test frontend build and run in production mode locally, run the following command in the root folder:

```
npm run start
```

## Backend commands

After starting the remix application, the CMS is available at `/studio`

## Making changes in the cms

Navigate to `cms/schematypes`

- `index.ts` contains all the different types and documents that are shown in Sanity Studio.
- `/objects` contains different types that are reused across the different documents

### Apply new changes to Sanity Studio üìÇ

Inside the root folder, run these commands:

#### 1. Schema extraction

```
npx sanity schema extract
```

##### 2. Generate types from schema

```
npx sanity typegen generate
```

### Dynamic classnames in Tailwind

You can't use dynamic class naming like bg-${color} in Tailwind out of the box with Sanity. When Tailwind compiles the CSS, it checks the code for a class name that matches, but it will only find classes that exist as a complete unbruken string in the source files. Tailwind can't find the dynamic classes at runtime since it does not yet exist. As a workaround, to avoid having to write out all possible combinations in strings with functions and if-sentences (which was done at first, and required lots of code each time a new color-combination was added), we use a Safelist in tailwind.config.js, where we generate the possible combinations of colorsWithVariants and StyleProps so that Tailwind can find them when compiling. This makes it possible to avoid having to write a new function for each styleprop that handles each case of colorcombination.

### Internationalization üá≥üá¥üá¨üáß

To implement language in a new document type:

- Inside `cms/structure/documentInternationalization.ts` add the new document to schemaTypes

### Singletons üìÑ

This script will create one or many "singleton" documents for each language. It works by appending the language ID to the document ID and creating the translations.metadata document

1. Take a backup of your dataset with:

```
npx sanity dataset export
```

2. Copy this file to the root of your Sanity Studio project

3. Update the SINGLETONS and LANGUAGES constants to your needs

4. Run the script (replace <schema-type> with the name of your schema type):

```
npx sanity exec ./createSingletons.ts --with-user-token
```

5. Update your desk structure to use the new documents

6. Import the saved dataset:

```
npx sanity dataset import [exported dataset].tar.gz [your chosen dataset] --missing
```

## Frontend üíÖ

### Add new colors to Tailwind

Open `frontend/tailwind.config.js`:

- Add the hex code and name under `extend: {colors: { ... }}`

### Add new color themes üé®

Open `frontend/app/utils/colorCombinations.ts`

- Add a new case to all of the functions used

### SVG files

- Find `.svg` graphic components and masks in `frontend/app/assets`
